## Introduction

#### Value of data: 
Fundamental unit of any organization is data. Data derives decision-making in most organizations. e.g.

* Where to locate a new franchise
* What customers to target in marketing
* Where bottlenecks exist in a process
* How customers feel about a product

Data needs to be in a format that allows for qualitative, quantitative and statistical analysis. In an ideal world data is well organized with no element missing and properly formatted. Although real world data is often unformatted or formatted in a way that is not conducive to analysis or is missing critical pieces.

#### Role of Data scientist 
Data scientists turn data from various sources into actionable information.
* Collecting the data in the raw form
* Data munging and data wrangling to make it useful for analysis and visualization.
* Cleaning of data to deal with missing values
* Curation of data to make it available for reuse and preservation

## Big Data
Big data is a relatively new term that describes data set that are so large and complex that traditional methods of storing and processing them are not sufficient. The need and importance of big data can be depicted easily with the following statistics:
  
  Every 60 seconds there are 
  * Over 100,000 tweets.
  * 695,000 Facebook status updates.
  * 11 million instant messages.
  * 700,000+ Google searches.
  * 168 million+ emails sent.
  * 1,820 TB of data created.
  * 217 new mobile web users.

Above statistics is just a glimpse of volume of data, which is constantly growing:
* Every day over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being generated
* 90% of the world’s data has been generated over the past two years
* Data from multiple sources is being integrated into single massive data sets.

Due to the complexity involved with the term itself there is no single agreed upon definition of “Big Data”, One possible definition:
>Big data is the integration of large amounts of multiple types of structured and unstructured data into a single data set that can be analyzed to gain insight and new understanding of an industry, business, the environment, medicine, disease control, science, and the human interactions and expectations.

Examples of Big data:
* The Large Hadron Collider would generate 5 ×1020bytes per day if all of its sensors were turned on, almost 200 times more than all other data sources in the world combined.
* The Square Kilometer Array radio telescope is expected to collect 14 exabytesof data per day for analysis
* Walmart generates over 1 million customer transactions per hour that are curated in a multi-petabyte database for trend analysis

Larger data sets allow for more detailed analysis and application to social sciences, biology, pharmacology, business, marketing and more. Data is everywhere and a lot of it is free. Organizations don't necessarily have to build their own massive data repositories before starting with big data analytics. Steps taken by many companies and government agencies to put large amounts of information into the public domain have made large volumes of data accessible to everyone.

Some of the Important sources of data are:
##### Web Behavior and content:
* There are nearly five billion web pages
* Collected data includes network traffic, site and page visits, page navigation, page searches

##### User Generated Content:
* Also known as "Internet trail" or "Net trail"
* Content generated by millions of users on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, YouTube, forums, wikis, and so forth

##### Activity Generated data:
* Computer and mobile device log files 
* Includes web site tracking information, application logs, sensor data such as check-ins and other location tracking

##### RFID Data:
* Radio Frequency Identifiers
* Tags for tracking merchandise and shipments, mobile payments, sports performance measurement, and automated toll collection

##### Geo Data:
* GPS tracking data generated by mobile devices
* Tracking of movement of equipment, vehicles, and people

##### Environmental Data:
* Weather conditions
* Tidal movements
* Seismic activity

##### Organizational Transactional Data:
* Transactional activities such as purchases, registration, manufacturing

##### Research Data:
* Social science data, e.g., census, polls
* Health care data
* Education, law and order, economic activity, agriculture, food production
* “Big Data” such as radio telescopes, particle physics

Big data is set to offer tremendous insights, but with the terabytes and petabytes of data pouring in to organizations today, traditional architectures are not up to the challenge. There are many challenges which comes along with big data:
* Analysis - With the enormous amount of data available the major challenge is to leverage the value that data have to offer.
* Collection - 
  * Data is not free.
  * Data is in format not conducive to analysis.
  * Data contains missing values or bad entries.
  * Data is not downloadable.
* Storage - Storage of such enormous data is a challenge in itself. There is a need for the system to be able to deal with terabytes/petabytes of data on a daily basis.
* Curation - Curation of data deals with addressing the quality of data. Data has a real value only if it is accurate and timely and thus can help in the decision making process.
* Search and retrieval - Timely retrival of meaningful data from the entire data set is one of the most important challenge.
* Sharing / Transfer - Sharing/Transferring data is another concern as there is no platform easily available which allows transfer of such huge data, Organizations tend to invest a lot of money to design special architectures and infrastructures to facilitate data sharing/transfer.
* Visualization - Visualization helps in extracting the meaningful information by processing the data and representing it in a way which can be easily deduced.
* Privacy - Data security becomes the major concern especially when it comes to credit card data, personal ID information or other sensitive assets.
