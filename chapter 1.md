#### Value of data: 
Fundamental unit of any organization is data. Data derives decision-making in most organizations. e.g.

* Where to locate a new franchise
* What customers to target in marketing
* Where bottlenecks exist in a process
* How customers feel about a product

Data needs to be in a format that allows for qualitative, quantitative and statistical analysis. In an ideal world data is well organized with no element missing and properly formatted. Although real world data is often unformatted or formatted in a way that is not conducive to analysis or is missing critical pieces.

Data scientists turn data from various sources into actionable information.
* Collecting the data in the raw form
* Data munging and data wrangling to make it useful for analysis and visualization.
* Cleaning of data to deal with missing values
* Curation of data to make it available for reuse and preservation
