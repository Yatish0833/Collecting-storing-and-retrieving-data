## Introduction

#### Value of data: 
Fundamental unit of any organization is data. Data derives decision-making in most organizations. e.g.

* Where to locate a new franchise
* What customers to target in marketing
* Where bottlenecks exist in a process
* How customers feel about a product

Data needs to be in a format that allows for qualitative, quantitative and statistical analysis. In an ideal world data is well organized with no element missing and properly formatted. Although real world data is often unformatted or formatted in a way that is not conducive to analysis or is missing critical pieces.

#### Role of Data scientist 
Data scientists turn data from various sources into actionable information.
* Collecting the data in the raw form
* Data munging and data wrangling to make it useful for analysis and visualization.
* Cleaning of data to deal with missing values
* Curation of data to make it available for reuse and preservation

## Big Data
Big data is a relatively new term that describes data set that are so large and complex that traditional methods of storing and processing them are not sufficient. The need and importance of big data can be depicted easily with the following statistics:
  
  Every 60 seconds there are 
  * Over 100,000 tweets.
  * 695,000 Facebook status updates.
  * 11 million instant messages.
  * 700,000+ Google searches.
  * 168 million+ emails sent.
  * 1,820 TB of data created.
  * 217 new mobile web users.

Above statistics is just a glimpse of volume of data, which is constantly growing:
* Every day over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being generated
* 90% of the world’s data has been generated over the past two years
* Data from multiple sources is being integrated into single massive data sets.

Due to the complexity involved with the term itself there is no single agreed upon definition of “Big Data”, One possible definition:
>Big data is the integration of large amounts of multiple types of structured and unstructured data into a single data set that can be analyzed to gain insight and new understanding of an industry, business, the environment, medicine, disease control, science, and the human interactions and expectations.

Larger data sets allow for more detailed analysis and application to social sciences, biology, pharmacology, business, marketing and more.
